# This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The main objective of this project was to create a (Single Page Application)**(SPA)** applying my knowledge in React and incorporating route protection.

It consists of a search engine of super heroes of Marvel and DC with images already preloaded where on having filtered a search a card appears with the super hero and his principal characteristics

In the not so distant future I will add good styles to be a more pleasant application to the public eye, while I will continue my studies with React.

If you want you can see the app in the following [link](https://luismgil.github.io/heroes-app/).
